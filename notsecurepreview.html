  <h1>We can't show you a preview of this site.</h1>
  <p>Unfortunately, we can't show you a preview of the website you just tried to preview.</p>
  <p>This is because of the way HTTP<b>S</b> works. HTTPS sites cannot show content of HTTP sites in iframes, images or even scripts. In this case, we tried to load an iframe but your browser stopped us.</p>
  <p>In short, the site you wanted to preview isn't secure, meaning that, as Searchly is a secure website, we can't use insecure content. Note that a site being insecure does NOT mean it is misleading or a scam, just that the data you send to the site can be viewed by other people, not just you and the server.</p>
